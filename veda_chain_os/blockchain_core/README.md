# Blockchain Core

This directory contains the components for the VEDA Chain OS Base Layer â€“ a Quantum-Secure Blockchain.

## Key Features:
-   **Cryptography**: Lattice-based cryptography for post-quantum security.
-   **Consensus**: Hybrid Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and AI Validators.
-   **Smart Contracts**: To be implemented in Rust with an AI-optimized Domain Specific Language (DSL).
-   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Utilizing zk-SNARKS & zk-STARKS.
-   **Scalability**: Auto-scalable sharding.
-   **Governance**: On-chain governance using a DAO 2.0 model.

Development has begun on the **Cryptography** module, with an initial structure for lattice-based post-quantum algorithms. We plan to use libraries from the `pqcrypto` suite.

Further details on each component will be added as development progresses.
