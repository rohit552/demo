        "*   Dependency conflicts were a significant challenge, particularly involving `pydantic`, `langchain`, and `transformers`, in the pre-configured Colab environment. Explicitly installing compatible versions helped, but complete resolution remained difficult.\n",
        "*   Accessing gated models from Hugging Face is not feasible within the standard Colab execution flow due to the requirement for interactive authentication; truly open-access models or external hosting with proper authentication (`huggingface-cli login` or `HF_TOKEN`) are necessary for a production environment.\n",
        "*   Setting up vLLM for efficient model serving with GPUs was conceptually outlined but could not be implemented or verified in the Colab environment.\n",
        "*   A conceptual FastAPI backend API structure was successfully outlined, including endpoints for session management, text chat, image chat, and student data access, demonstrating the integration points with conceptual database functions and a placeholder LangChain agent executor.\n",
        "*   A critical error in the LangChain agent prompt template (missing `{tool_names}` and `{tools}`) was identified and corrected, allowing the conceptual agent and executor to be instantiated successfully.\n",
        "*   A detailed plan was outlined for integrating STT (Faster-Whisper) and TTS (XTTS-v2) capabilities using WebSockets for real-time audio streaming, including considerations for latency and performance optimization on GPUs.\n",
        "*   A conceptual implementation of the image chat endpoint was provided, showing how image data would be received, processed by a conceptual multimodal model, and integrated into the LangChain agent's input.\n",
        "*   Attempts to implement actual PostgreSQL database interaction functions using `psycopg2` failed repeatedly due to a persistent `IndentationError` within the Python code, specifically affecting the `record_exercise_performance` function, preventing the successful definition of all database functions.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   For a real-world deployment, prioritize establishing a clean, controlled Python environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`) to reliably manage dependencies and avoid conflicts encountered in the Colab environment.\n",
        "*   Resolving the persistent `IndentationError` in the database functions is critical. This might require careful manual inspection of the code for hidden characters or testing in a different execution environment capable of providing more detailed error information.\n"

A Python script was used to print a markdown outline of these components.\n",
        "2.  **Conceptualize AI-Powered IQ Assessment:** This subtask focused on outlining the technical approach for the AI IQ test, covering question generation, assessment logic, cognitive strength identification, and adaptive testing using AI. A Python script generated a JSON outline of this approach.\n",
        "3.  **Design Customized Learning Path Generation:** This involved detailing how personalized learning paths would be created based on IQ results and user interests, leveraging personalization concepts. A Python script produced a JSON outline describing the inputs, process, influencing factors, structures, and dynamic adjustment of the learning paths.\n",
        "4.  **Outline Learning Module Implementation:** This step conceptualized the structure and content of basic learning modules (speed reading, memory enhancement, logical reasoning) and how AI would enhance them through personalization, adaptivity, and feedback. It also considered RAG integration and progress tracking. A Python script generated a JSON outline for this.\n",
        "5.  **Plan Community Engagement Features:** This subtask outlined features for the online community, including discussion forums, collaboration tools, and potential AI integration points within the community. A Python script produced a JSON outline of these features.\n",
        "6.  **Conceptualize Premium Features:** This involved detailing the implementation of premium features such as live mentor sessions, webinars, advanced learning modules, and enhanced AI capabilities for premium users. A Python script generated a JSON outline of these premium features.\n",

A Python script produced a JSON outline of these AI integration points.\n",
        "8.  **Design User Management and Plan Tiers:** This subtask focused on the technical design of user registration, authentication, profiles, plan tier management, access control for premium features, and the logic for plan upgrades/downgrades, along with data privacy considerations. A Python script generated a JSON outline for this system.\n",

        "1.  **Understand Program Core Components:** The initial step involved analyzing the program description to identify and categorize the core components, including the AI IQ assessment, learning modules, mentorship, and the Free/Premium plan tiers. A Python script was used to print a markdown outline of these components.\n",
        "2.  **Conceptualize AI-Powered IQ Assessment:** This subtask focused on outlining the technical approach for the AI IQ test, covering question generation, assessment logic, cognitive strength identification, and adaptive testing using AI. A Python script generated a JSON outline of this approach.\n",
        "3.  **Design Customized Learning Path Generation:** This involved detailing how personalized learning paths would be created based on IQ results and user interests, leveraging personalization concepts. A Python script produced a JSON outline describing the inputs, process, influencing factors, structures, and dynamic adjustment of the learning paths.\n",
        "4.  **Outline Learning Module Implementation:** This step conceptualized the structure and content of basic learning modules (speed reading, memory enhancement, logical reasoning) and how AI would enhance them through personalization, adaptivity, and feedback. It also considered RAG integration and progress tracking. A Python script generated a JSON outline for this.\n",
        "5.  **Plan Community Engagement Features:** This subtask outlined features for the online community, including discussion forums, collaboration tools, and potential AI integration points within the community. A Python script produced a JSON outline of these features.\n",
        "6.  **Conceptualize Premium Features:** This involved detailing the implementation of premium features such as live mentor sessions, webinars, advanced learning modules, and enhanced AI capabilities for premium users. A Python script generated a JSON outline of these premium features.\n",
        "7.  **Integrate AI into Program Features:** This step specifically identified points where existing AI capabilities (content generation, emotional responsiveness, autonomous agents) could be integrated across various Skillheed features (practice questions, feedback, explanations, community). A Python script produced a JSON outline of these AI integration points.\n",
        "8.  **Design User Management and Plan Tiers:** This subtask focused on the technical design of user registration, authentication, profiles, plan tier management, access control for premium features, and the logic for plan upgrades/downgrades, along with data privacy considerations. A Python script generated a JSON outline for this system.\n",
        "9.  **Consider Technical Architecture (High-Level):** The final step involved outlining a high-level technical architecture encompassing the frontend, backend, database, AI model integration points, external service integrations, and infrastructure.

It will also incorporate detailed proctoring features covering authentication, monitoring, and cheating prevention using various technical methods.\n",
        "*   Personalized learning paths will be generated by analyzing IQ results, student interests, goals, and prior knowledge, mapping these to specific modules and topics, applying personalization concepts like adapting to learning style, and dynamically adjusting based on ongoing progress and interaction.\n",
        "*   Basic learning modules for Speed Reading, Memory Enhancement, and Logical Reasoning will feature structured topics, progressive content, and interactive activities, significantly enhanced by AI for personalized explanations, adaptive difficulty, AI-generated practice content, and real-time feedback, potentially leveraging RAG integration and contributing data to progress tracking.\n",
        "*   Community features will include topic-based discussion forums with moderation and search, as well as collaboration tools like group creation, project spaces, and direct messaging, with AI potentially assisting in moderation, suggesting relevant discussions, and identifying struggling users.\n",
        "*   Premium features will add Live Mentor Sessions with scheduling and video integration, Webinars/Workshops with live streaming and recording access, more Advanced Learning Modules on complex topics, and Enhanced AI Features including deeper personalization and access to more advanced AI models or proactive insights.\n",
        "*   AI integration points are extensive, including generating tailored practice questions/exercises, providing personalized and emotionally responsive feedback, offering personalized explanations within modules using RAG, and leveraging autonomous agents for tasks like generating comprehensive progress reports or suggesting next steps.\n",
        "*   User management will cover registration (email/password, social login), token-based authentication, detailed user profiles storing progress and assessment data, plan tier management (Free/Premium) enforced by backend access control, and logic for plan upgrades/downgrades integrated with payment processing, while prioritizing data privacy and security.\n",
        "*   The high-level technical architecture is envisioned as a service-oriented approach with a modern frontend (React/Vue/Angular), a Python/FastAPI backend orchestrating logic and AI models (via LangChain/CrewAI), a PostgreSQL database for data storage, integration points for various AI models (LLMs, STT, TTS, Multimodal, Sentiment, Vector DB), and integrations with external services (payment, video, email), all hosted on a scalable cloud infrastructure.\n",
